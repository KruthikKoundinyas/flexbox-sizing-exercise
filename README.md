Flexbox Sizing Exercise
- Developed an interactive web application to practice and demonstrate proficiency in CSS Flexbox layout.
- The application provides a hands-on exercise for users to manipulate the size, growth, and shrink properties of flex items.
- Implemented a feature that allows users to write and apply their own CSS code to flex items, enhancing their understanding of Flexbox.
- Utilized HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build the application, focusing on responsive design and user interaction.
- The project showcases my ability to create flexible, responsive layouts and my understanding of modern web design principles.
